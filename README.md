# typescript-maps
This is a little basic Typescript application that randomly generate  two entities: a Company (name, location, business, etc), an a User(name, last name, location, age, etc). The Company and the User locations are used to generate a location-marker in a google map.

The entire goal of this application is to get familiar with interfaces and classes in Typescript, in order to get some amount of code reuse on the applications I work on.
